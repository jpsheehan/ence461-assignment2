Power Supply
Opamps are to be powered off 5V. 
Assume the microcontroller will be a 3.3V device therefore therta re two supplies 1 for Opam aone for microporcess.
Use the 5V supply just for the opamps.
May require the 5V and/or half rail (3,5V) to be connected to the micro ADC reference as well. But these do not draw current.


5V supply to ADC amplifiers
Requirements
Linear device
5V output
>= 105 degrees
6V input.
RoHS comlaint
SMD
Ideally a low dropout voltage at full load. 
Minimum additional components
Mising: ouput current

Output current calculations
12 ADC channels and mx current 2.7mA round this to 3mA too allow some overhead.
Add 1x opamp toi generate the 2.5volt reference signal.
13 x 3mA = 39mA.

Option 1 - seperate 5V and 3V3 supplies

Using the Digikey part sselector and setting Vin max to 10V we arrive at

3.3V supply to microprocessor
Requirements
Switching device (since micor is high speed device) 
3.3V output
>= 105 degrees
6V input.
RoHS comlaint
SMD
Minimum additional components
Mising: ouput current
ouput current calulations

If we assume the micopr and perpahals (associated wit hthe m,icor that run of 3.3V) will comsume 500mA in total we can use. CAT6219-330TDGT3 but this is last time buy.

Assume the micrprocessor and periphasd (associated wit hthe m,icor that run of 3.3V) will comsume 150mA in total, the digikey selctor with 10V max inout gives

quantity 101 = $107.16

Option 2 - combined 5V and 3V3 supplies

Op-Amps:
========

Need 12 opamp circuits for each slave board.

The LMV324AIPWR has four opamp circuits per package.
So we only need 12 / 4 * 92 = 368 of these.
The part number on Digi-Key is [296-51366-1-ND ](https://www.digikey.co.nz/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LMV324AIPWR/296-51366-1-ND/9745730).
For 368, we have a buy price of $0.36704 per unit

This part doesn't have an enable line so we will have to also use a mosfet to drive the positive supply voltage to ground to disable. This chip has a 50 us startup time.
