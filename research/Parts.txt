Power Supply
Opamps are to be powered off 5V, a 2.5V (half rail) reference is required and we will assume, at this stage, microcontroller will be a 3.3V device. 
Therefore multiple supply rails are needed.
Optiom 1 - two seperate regulators
5V supply for the opamps and 1/2 rail.
May require the 5V and/or half rail to connect to micro ADC reference as well, but assume this rail does not require current.

5V supply to Opamp ADC amplifiers
Requirements
Linear device
5V output
>= 105 degrees
6V input.
RoHS comlaint
SMD
Ideally a low dropout voltage at full load. 
Minimum additional components
Missing parameter: ouput current.

Output current calculations
12 ADC channels and max current 2.7mA. Round up to 3mA gives some overhead.
Further opamp for the 2.5 volt reference. 13 x 3mA = 39mA.

Using the Digikey part sselector 
RoHSm datasheet, active part, 125 degrees, Vin max = 10V (allow some overhead for 6V input) gives:
1)
ADP1720ARMZ-R7
Datasheet ADP1720ARMZ-R7
Which has ouput current 50mA, VDO 275mV, -40 to 125 degree C

Datasheet http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21350E.pdf

Choose TC1054-5.0VCT713â€Ž because
Low drop out voltage (supply is only 6V and we need 5V out) typically 85mV max 120mV
It provies control pins. These may be required to shutdown the ADC amps into low power. (50uSec start up time for opamp)
Note that the ramp up time from shutdown to active is less than 100uSec. T start is therfore 100 + 50 = 150uSec
There are 100 and 150mA versions so if dicsover greater current is required this part can be uprated.

Thermal consderations.
PD worst case operating = (Vin - Vout) x Imax => (6.5-5)*50 = 75mW
PD max = (TJ - TA)/ thetaJA => (125-105) / 220 = 90.90mW
Thus PDMax > PD worst therfore device is suitable fro mthermal perspective.
However vin max = PD max/Imax + Vo => 90.909mW/50mA + 5 = 6.81V max.
Thus the supply input voltage must not exceed 6.8V, however Vin max is 6.5V.

93 units are required (assuming there is a need for 5V in the master unit)
Purhase of 100 units is reduces the cost by 20C and proves 7 spares
100x 0.46340 = $46.34

3.3V supply to microprocessor
Requirements
Linear devie since ADC is it main function.
3.3V output
>= 105 degrees
6V input.
RoHS compliantt
SMD
Minimum additional components
Mising parameter: ouput current
Output current calulations

If we assumed at this stage the micro and 3V3 periphials will comsume 500mA in total we can use CAT6219-330TDGT3 but 
 this is last time buy according to digikey and is likely overspecified.

Assume at this stage the micro and 3V3 periphials will comsume 150mA in total 
(micro, LED x 2, possbible buss chips)

Using the Digikey part sselector 
RoHSm datasheet, active part, 125 degrees, Vin max = 10V (allows overhead for 6V input) gives 

Selet the following part due to
Minimum external compents, on board protection.
Digikey 296-11021-1-ND, TPS76333DBVR
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps763.pdf?HQS=TI-null-null-digikeymode-df-pf-null-wwe&ts=1590036136348
It is known that there are 6V versions and also 250mA versions whcih may have a similar form factor, 
 so the part could be changed if higher Iout is required.

Thermal consderations.
PD worst case operating = (Vin - Vout) x Imax => (6.5-3.3)V * 150mA = 480mW
PD max = (TJ - TA)/ thetaJA => (125-105) / 205.3 = 97.41 mW
Thus PDMax < PD worst therfore device is not suitable.

TPS76633, TPD706-150 and others => not suitable

Check
Digikey 296-19675-1-ND, TPS71733DCKR
Tj = Tt + gamma?jt * PD max => 105 + 2.7*480mW = 106.296 less than Toperating max = 125 
Tj = Tb + gamma?jb * PD max => 105 + 40.9* 480mW = 124.632 degress just less than Toperating max = 125 
This is on the limit at 6.5V input 
At 6.0 Vin Tj = 121 degrees - still less than Toperating max = 125 
VDO = 300mV worst case.
100 x 1.00190 =  $100.19 

Option 2 - combined 5V and 3V3 supplies
Maybe later


Op-Amps:
========
Option 1
Need 12 opamp circuits for each slave board.
and one more for reliable 1/2 rail.

The LMV324AIPWR has four opamp circuits per package.
So we only need 12 / 4 * 92 = 368 of these.
The part number on Digi-Key is [296-51366-1-ND ](https://www.digikey.co.nz/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LMV324AIPWR/296-51366-1-ND/9745730).
For 368, we have a buy price of $0.36704 per unit

This part doesn't have an enable line so we will have to also use a mosfet to drive the positive supply voltage to ground to disable. 
This chip has a 50 us startup time.
Gets to within 20mV of rail voltage.

150uA * 13 devices = 1.95mA == 2mA ??


Option 2
MCP632T-E/MFCT-ND provides chip enable/disable function and T operating of 125 degress. Tmax is 150 degrees so based on the likely current ouputs with no 
 ouptput limiting resistor comfortabel meets the PD max and PO max thermal considerations.
Optimies for single supply rail.
Input current is nomianll6 2.5mA per channel and 3.6mA max per channel.
Enable time is 4.5uSec.
3.6mA x 13 = 46.8 mA - within 5V regulator specification.
Checking pricing 368 dual units at 1.483 ea is the lowest cost option at $545.70. 4 Opamps per board, 1 ch unused. (could put jumpers on this)
Gets to within 40mV of rail voltage.
