\section{Conclusion}

A daughter-board was designed to take ADC readings from a current transducer within a thermally and electrically noisy environment.
Operational amplifiers were used to amplify the sensor voltages and low-pass RC filters were used to condition the signals.
A microcontroller was used to quantise the analog readings into a form that can be further conditioned in software.
A CAN transceiver was used to transmit the data to a master-board where the data is collated and sent to a data-logger via the 802.11b/g/n protocol.
