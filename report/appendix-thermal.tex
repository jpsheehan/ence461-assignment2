\section{Thermal}
The system require is for reliable operating at an ambient temperature of 105 degrees C.
Therefore, all sourced parts have a minimum operating temperature of 105 degrees.
Several components have been selected for 125 degree C or above operation to reliability, these are listed in following sections.

\subsection{Regulator Thermal Calculations}
\label{ap:regulator}
For reliable operation the regulator junction temperature must not exceed 125 degrees. Junction temperature is a function of ambient temperature and power dissipated, due to load current and voltage differential between supply and output. $\theta$J_A define the devices ability dissipate heat.
Using a SOIC 8-Ld device $\theta$J_A is 65 degrees. PD_max = (T_max - T_ambient)\divide$\theta$J_A 
Thus PD^max = (125-105)\divide65 = 317.46mW
PD_operating = (V_IN - V_OUT)\timesV_OUT 
Thus PD_worst case = 6-5)*200mW = 200mW
Hence PD_worst case < PDmax :. device is suitable.
Substituting in PD_MAX and rearranging shows the maximum continuous supply rail voltage is 6.585V giving a limited safety margin.
IF worst case operating current is used the supply rail could go slightly higher.
Note that V_in max is 26V.

\subsection{Opamp Thermal Calculations}
\label{ap:amplifier}
Power dissipation is a function of the difference between supply voltage to output voltage, output voltage difference to ground (for single supply devices) and the output current. At low frequencies the RC filter presents the high input impedance MCU ADC input to the opamp output. Thus, the load is high impedance and little current is consumed. At high frequencies the opamp output is 560 ohms and current is increased. However, noise signals are expected to be lower in amplitude than signal thus overall current consumption will be within an estimated 2mA
Additionally the worst case quiescent current is $\SI{70}{\micro\ampere}$.
With a 5V supply and low current power dissipation is minimal, there is a comfortable margin between the ambient temperature of $\SI{105}{\degreeCelsius}$, the junction operating temperature of $\SI{125}{\degreeCelsius}$, and the device absolute maximum of $\SI{150}{\degreeCelsius}$.
